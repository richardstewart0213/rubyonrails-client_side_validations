The Javascript file is untested. It probably need a rewrite... but I suck at Javascript

The Uniqueness validation does too many server side calls.

Uniqueness doesn't work yet for nested fields

Validation checks currently happen on keyup, blur and form submission. The keyup and blur checks should be configurable.

Moar Browser testing!

SimpleForm support

fields_for should inherit the :validate on the form_for
